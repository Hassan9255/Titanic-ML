# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This is a basic machine learning project for the Titanic Kaggle competition. The goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster.

## 📁 Files
- `titanic.ipynb`: Main notebook with data cleaning, model training, and predictions  
- `train.csv`: Training dataset from Kaggle  
- `test.csv`: Test dataset from Kaggle  
- `submission.csv`: Final predictions for Kaggle submission  

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  

## 📌 Notes
The notebook includes:
- Data cleaning (dropping unused columns, filling missing values)  
- Simple model training  
- Generation of a submission file for Kaggle  

## 📊 Results
- **Positive (Survival) Prediction Accuracy:** 76%
